# Minesweeper

A simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game written in Java (and JavaFX). This project was part of the Multimedia Engineering course at 7th semester.

## Build Instructions

1. Make sure you have Java 17 and JavaFX 17
	> Note: I used Java v17.0.3.1 and JavaFX v17.0.6
2. For VS Code, make sure you have the Extension Pack for Java installed
3. Change the launch.json and settings.json files in the .vscode directory to match with the directory in which you have JavaFX
	> Note: For more information about setting up VS Code with JavaFX see [here](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/)
4. Enjoy
